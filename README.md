We have used this plugin for the page block editor. It's easy to manage content and easy to move blocks; we can also copy and paste blocks to other pages.

2) CZcustomeWP-Plugin

We have created a custom plugin for creating custom code. In this plugin, we have created a pricing table using coinmarketcap api. Here we create a shortcode to show the pricing table. Also, plugins have a style.css file where we have added custom styles for desktop and responsive screens.
